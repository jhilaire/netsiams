First and foremost, CDRMIP will provide information that can be used to help assess the potential and risks of using CDR to address climate change. A thorough assessment will need to look at both the impacts of CDR upon the Earth system and human society. CDRMIP will focus primarily on Earth system impacts, with the anticipation that this information will also be useful for understanding potential impacts upon society. The scientific outcomes will lead to more informed decisions about the role CDR may play in climate change mitigation (defined here as a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases). CDRMIP experiments will also provide an opportunity to better understand how the Earth system responds to perturbations, which is relevant to many of the Grand Science Challenges posed by the World Climate Research Program (WCRP; https://www.wcrp-climate.org/ grand-challenges/grand-challenges-overview). CDRMIP experiments provide a unique opportunity because the perturbations are often opposite in sign to previous CMIP perturbation experiments (CO2 is removed instead of added). Second, CDRMIP results may also be able to provide information that helps to understand how model resolution and complexity cause systematic model bias. In this instance, CDRMIP experiments may be especially useful for gaining a better understanding of the similarities and differences between global carbon cycle models because we invite a diverse group of models to participate in CDRMIP. Finally, CDRMIP results can help to quantify uncertainties in future climate change scenarios, especially those that include CDR.

This water scarcity could be alleviated using a larger fraction of precipitation but this will ultimately threaten natural ecosystems and human settlements.

(2013); Jones et al. (2016)). Using an ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle model Vichi et al. (2013) investigate two different sets of experiments, one with the imposition of a reference atmospheric CO2 concentration pathway and one with prescribed negative emissions and the atmospheric CO2 let free to evolve according to the surface fluxes and the general circulation. They show that both actions are anticipated to release the anthropogenic carbon stored in the surface ocean, effectively increasing the required removal effort and that the additional negative emissions are expected to be lower when the CDR policy is driven by planned removal rates without prescribing a target atmospheric CO2 concentration. Cao and Caldeira (2010) use an Earth system model to investigate the response of the coupled climate–carbon system to an instantaneous removal of all anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere. In their simulations a one-time removal of all anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere offsets less than 50 of the warming experienced at the time of removal and to maintain atmospheric CO2 concentrations at pre-industrial levels for centuries, an additional amount of CO2 equal to the original CO2 captured would need to be removed over the subsequent 80 years. Moreover, they observe that to maintain atmospheric CO2 and temperature at low levels, not only does anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere need to be removed, but anthropogenic CO2 stored in the ocean and land needs to be removed as well when it outgasses to the atmosphere. Finally, Jones et al. (2016) show that under low carbon pathways natural sinks will significantly weaken, hindering the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies and therefore increasing their required deployment to achieve a given climate stabilisation target.",1491.0,

3998,57301,hilj,"POLICY INSTRUMENT  Based on the first criterion for CCS and BECCS adoption the study suggests that:If CCS technologies are available, the most cost-effective instruments are those that directly price the pollution externality (carbon tax and subsidies). Fossil fuel tax is less cost effective because its fails to exploit the CCS abatement channel.Also, the specific subsidy (S3) is the most welfare improving instrument. However, it encourages the use of fossil fuel and speeds up resource extraction compared to other instruments that reduce demand for fossil fuel.Finally, implementing a carbon tax and recycling its revenues to BECCS subsidy (S5) is less costly in terms of welfare, than to develop the two-part instrument (S4, S’4). Revenue from the tax allows a much larger deployment of BECCS.",,,
